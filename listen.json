The more you save, the earlier you can retire.\n\nAssuming your expenses in retirement will be roughly equivalent to your expenses now, you can tell how much money you should save based on when you'd like to retire. And if you know how much you spend, and how much you save, that totals to how much you earn and can give us a percentage!\n\nFor this calculation we'll assume the following reasonable things:\n\n- You use a [4% Safe withdrawal rate](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Safe_withdrawal_rates) during retirement\n\n- You earn 5% rate of return on your investments after inflation\n\n- You plan to live a _long_ time, so you want your nest egg to keep the same [real value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics\\))\n\nSavings Rate | Working Years until Retirement\n-:|:-\n0%|âˆž\n5%|66\n10%|51\n15%|43\n20%|37\n25%|32\n33%|26\n50%|17\n67%|9.8\n75%|7.1\n80%|5.6\n90%|2.7\n95%|1.3\n100%|0.0\n\n[Here's a spreadsheet with the calculations!](https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAJbxS4DfKc4GZwkDE2B8kq-fV8eLqxVfF-E)"
